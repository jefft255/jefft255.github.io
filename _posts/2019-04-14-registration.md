# Quick facts:
* Terrestrial laser scanning produce high-quality 3D point clouds of forests
* We can fuse multiple scans (above, one in blue and one in black) to get a more complete coverage.
* However, one needs to place registration targets on the forest floor (highlighted in red in the picture above) which is time consuming for large areas.
* We propose a parallel algorithm which uses trees as registration targets and removes the need for artificial targets.
* The paper is available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924271618302892).
