# Quick facts:
* 1.4 hectares of forest mapped with a [Clearpath Husky](https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/husky-unmanned-ground-vehicle-robot/) and a [Velodyne HDL\-32E](https://velodynelidar.com/hdl-32e.html)
* 943 trees were manually segmented in point clouds, and their diameter and species was identified on the field.
* Biggest dataset for 3D forest mapping and tree diameter measurements
* We tested various diameter estimation methods
* Part of the [Automated Forestry and Logging Operations project](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Automated-forestry-and-logging-operations)
* Published and presented at the 12th Conference on Field and Service Robotics
* Our preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05281)
