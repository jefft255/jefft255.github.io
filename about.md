I am a first year Ph.D. student at McGill University's [Mobile Robotics Lab](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~mrl/) under the supervision of David Meger.
My research interests lie in the use of self-supervised machine learning for mobile robotics in natural environments.

Here is [my academic C.V.](../Academic_CV_English.pdf)

Previously, I was M.Sc. student in robotics at Universit√© Laval, in the [Norlab laboratory](https://norlab.ulaval.ca).
There, I studied mobile robotics and 3D mapping in the context of forestry.
