I am a second year M.Sc. student in robotics at Universit√© Laval, in the [Norlab laboratory](https://norlab.ulaval.ca).
I study mobile robotics and 3D mapping in the context of forestry.
Here is [my academic C.V.](../Academic_CV_English.pdf)

In September 2019, I will be joining McGill University's [Mobile Robotics Lab](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~mrl/).
